Thanks to [Christian Lempa](https://github.com/ChristianLempa/boilerplates/tree/main) and [Techo Tim](https://technotim.live/posts/truenas-docker-pro/) for inspiration.

## Docker Network Setup
These docker networks need to be setup first. Get a shell on the server and create these networks.
```shell
docker network create \
  --driver macvlan \
  --subnet=172.23.4.0/24 \
  --gateway=172.23.4.1 \
  --opt parent=eno1 \
  public

docker network create traefik
```

## Setup Custom Apps
1) Under applications, click on Discover Apps

   ![TrueNAS Apps](docs/img/truenas_apps.png)

1) Open the vertical ellipsis menu and select Install via YAML

   ![TrueNAS Discover Apps](docs/img/truenas_apps_discover.png)

1) Assign a name and enter the following into the YAML text box. Make sure to update the
   location of your application YAML file in the `include` template.
   ```yaml
   include:
     - /mnt/tachyon/selfhosted/APP_NAME/compose.yaml
   ```

## Traefik

Docker compose will automatically read in `.env` files for variable substitution. Once this
repo is cloned onto the server, create a `.env` file with your Cloudflare API key.
```shell
echo "CF_DNS_API_TOKEN=[... TOKEN GOES HERE ...]" > ./traefik/.env
```

Also make sure to update the Traefik static [config file here](./traefik/config.yaml).

## MakeMKV
I have two optical drives on my server so I have two instances of MakeMKV set up in my 
docker compose file. Each instance has the proper devices mounted into the container.

On my server the optical drives are assigned to these file handles.
 - `"/dev/sr0"` <=> `"/dev/sg2"`
 - `"/dev/sr1"` <=> `"/dev/sg3"`


If you copy this, make sure to validate the `USER_ID` and `GROUP_ID` environment variables
values match your `truenas_admin` IDs
